            <p> To solve equations with one variable, It is necesery to know the steps.</p>
            There is different type of steps but the goal should be to leave x or the variable to find the solution.
            There are property of addition, sabtraction, multiply, division. We can use these property but we should always do " what you did the one side you should add to the other side" so they can be equal.

            <p> Solving equation with two variable is the same solving equation with one variable. It is the same case you need to have x alone. Still you have the properties.</p>

            <p> Solving system of equation is the similar as solving equation with one variables but this time you have to find a solution of (x,y)</p>
            <p>WE can find the solution with elimination, graphing, substitution. </p>

            <br>
            <p> To solve this equation one way is elimination.
                The way to do elimination is by the property of addition. The propert of addition rule is to add both side the same value and as long there is an equal sign we are adding the same value. </p>
            <h5>One example is this</h5>
            <p>{3x+y=5
                <br>
                2x−y=0}
            <p> The steps are there:
                First you have to form a standard form,
                <br>
                3x+y=5
                <br>
                + 2x−y=0
                <br>
                Then we have to deside wchich variable to eliminate, How do we decide? In this case it is "y".
            </p>
            <br>
            5x + 0 = 5
            <br>
            5x = 5
            <br>
            <p>From this try to leave x alone by dividing 5 both side.</p>
            <br>
            <h3> x= 1</h3>
            <p>In system of equations the additional work is that we have to find a solution of (x,y) so we plog x to the equations and finf y</p>
            3(1) + y = 5 => multply 3 and 1
            <br>
            3 + y = 5 => Use the subtraction property
            <br>
            Y is 2
            <br>
            The solution is (1,2)
